# GTEx (V9) Long Read RNA-Seq Transcript Quantification Data Analysis
*WORK IN PROGRESS*

The Jupyter Notebook in this repository contains analysis and visualization code of transcript quantification data that are publicly available on [GTEx Portal](https://www.gtexportal.org/home/datasets).

I followed a similar analysis and visualization procedure implemented in Glinos et al. paper [1]. I also used the supplemental information and tables provided in their publication.

Transcript quantification was done through the [Flair](https://flair.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules.html#flair-quantify) and the [LIQA](https://github.com/WGLab/LIQA) program.
